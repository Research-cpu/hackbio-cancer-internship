**Central Dogma of Molecular Biology**

Authors: Nada Ghozlan (@Nad1)

The central dogma of molecular biology is a fundamental principle, found in all organisms, which describes the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein, which consequently determines an organism’s phenotype. The concept was first elaborated by Francis Crick in 1958 [(Laurentin Táriba, 2023)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?uxh37g).

**Pathways of the Central Dogma**

The flow of the central dogma involves 3 natural pathways: The first pathway is DNA replication, in which the cell duplicates its DNA, creating two copies of the original DNA molecule. The second pathway is transcription, in which the information in a DNA sequence is copied into a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. The third pathway is translation, in which the mRNA sequence is used in the ribosomes to synthesize a polypeptide chain, producing the proteins that contribute to the organism’s phenotype. Moreover, there is a fourth pathway, which is reverse transcription. It is an exception to the flow of the central dogma that usually occurs in retroviruses and under in vitro conditions, in which RNA is converted into DNA [(Laurentin Táriba, 2023)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?0apV5J).

**The Central Dogma: Cancer Biomarkers**

Understanding the central dogma, including the pathways of transcription and translation, is crucial for understanding the regulation of gene expression. The innovation of techniques that use the central dogma helps control the pathways of transcription and translation more accurately to reduce unwanted gene expression [(Greco et al., 2021)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?KXe222). Techniques such as polyribosome profiling and RNA-Seq help study translation efficiency in tumors by identifying which mRNAs are translated more in cancer cells. This technique helps find possible biomarkers and therapeutic targets [(Adjibade et al., 2016)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?0FgvuX). Additionally, cancer cells disrupt translational control processes, resulting in overexpression of oncogenes and cancer-promoting proteins. This disruption can also help identify biomarkers that are useful for diagnosing and predicting cancer, as they reveal tumors’ adaptive response to stress conditions and therapy [(Vaklavas et al., 2017)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?ckAkAg).

There are a few examples that demonstrate the importance of understanding the pathways in central dogma (Transcription and translation). For instance, an enzyme called KDM4A (Lysine Demethylase 4A) has a role in transcription regulation and protein translation in the cytoplasm. Its overexpression or mutations can contribute to increased cell proliferation and cancer disease progression. A genetic variant in KDM4A called SNP-A482 can predict sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, making it a potential biomarker for targeted therapy [(Rothbart et al., 2015)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?4maOcz).

**Conclusion**

The central dogma of molecular biology, which includes DNA replication, transcription, translation, and reverse transcription, is important for understanding how genetic information is processed and used in cells. By studying these processes, especially in cancer, researchers can better understand how gene expression changes and identify potential new biomarkers.
